# digilogOSC
control guitar pedals via OSC-messages

## install ##
* clone or download
* go to folder in terminal
* npm install
* npm start
* go to localhost:8001 in the browser for the web-editor

at this moment this software is theoretical capable of converting OSC messages to serial message that control modified guitar pedals. 

The web interface show some information about the pedals and the possible OSC-messages and the ranges of their values. 

The pedals shown are the current active pedals with a serial connection. I need to add the pedals with midi control.
